### Hi there🍍


My name is Anna (pronounced Ana) and I'm currently a software engineer at Github on the Dependency Graph team.

- My favorite programming language is Go 🐨, followed by Rust, and I'm generally interested in wrangling distributed systems 👩‍🔬
- I like 🐱 and 🐶, ☕ and 🍵, 🌴 and 🌲, 🌊 and ⛰️, New York and LA 
- 🗽 I'm a New Yorker and feel at home in 🧡Montreal and Berlin💛
- 🎹 My favorite musicians are [Hania Rani](https://open.spotify.com/artist/14YzutUdMwS9yTnI0IFBaD?si=Np4V4UdYR06IuavEpN0JBQ), [Agnes Obel](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1rKrEdI6GKirxWHxIUPYms?si=8BNLg3O-T3iVMHJo469G9A) and [Rhye](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2AcUPzkVWo81vumdzeLLRN?si=qil8FB-DQYyX3GFU9cEoqg)
- 🍉 Clear and intentional (especially technical) written communication is my love language
- 📜 I occasionaly [write](https://nnrsntl.substack.com/) and often like [other people's tweets](https://twitter.com/nnrsntl)
- 🎻 If I weren't a software engineer by day, I would be a librarian (the one who reads essays, short stories or memoirs all day and plays piano from time to time), or an orchestra conductor

- 🌊 I'm forever interested in existentialism, sustainability, minimalism, anti-consumerism and dismantling heteropatriarchy 
- 🖤 To me, you can never be too educated, too humble, too kind, too communicative or too well-dressed
